<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About Sage
Sage is a **cross-platform system package manager** that helps you download,
install, update and remove software packages at will, and you can do so
with just a couple commands. 

But wait, you may be telling yourself: 
*"What even is a system package manager?"*
Well, it's quite like your typical package managers, like
node's npm or rust's cargo. The difference is that it's not associated to a
specific programming language, but rather to your operating system.
With things like npm and cargo you would install libraries or binaries
written in their associated programming language, but with a system package
manager, like Sage, you can install anything that you want, from tools like 
`cat` or `grep` to programming language SDKs like `openjdk`, provided that it is somehow available to the package manager.

If you are familiar with Linux, and to some extent with macOs, then you
have probably used a package manager of this sort before. 
Debian's [apt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)), 
Arch's [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman) 
and macOs's [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) are a couple of examples of
system package managers that people which use those OSes interact with
all the time.

I know that by now you may be thinking:
*"If there are so many system package managers out there,
then why bother creating a new one? This sounds like a waste of time, I'll
just leave".* **Wait**! Don't go anywhere just yet and hear me out, because
there is a very good reason for another package manager to exist.

<TODO talk about the fact that there is no cross platform spm and 
about the fact that it runs fast and securely>
